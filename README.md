# Habitat: Hoard

**🚧
This project is currently under heavy development, any information may be subject to change.
🚧**

Habitat provides modular functionality for deployment on home lab devices. \
Each of the modules is designed as an opinionated docker stack that can be deployed on its own or together with other modules by sharing the same docker network.

## Available Modules

 - **[Path](https://github.com/Tschebbischeff/habitat-path)** \
 Network routing and reverse proxy
 - **[Scent](https://github.com/Tschebbischeff/habitat-scent)** \
 Identity provider, LDAP directory and access control
 - **[Chatter](https://github.com/Tschebbischeff/habitat-chatter)** \
 Message queue for realtime communication between modules
 - **[Sight](https://github.com/Tschebbischeff/habitat-sight)** \
 Real-time video streaming
 - **[Hoard](https://github.com/Tschebbischeff/habitat-hoard)** \
 Time-series database and persistent storage
 - **[Vigil](https://github.com/Tschebbischeff/habitat-vigil)** \
 Device monitoring, visualization and alerting
 - **[Vista](https://github.com/Tschebbischeff/habitat-vista)** \
 Central dashboards and device entry points

## Getting Started

### Requirements

 - *(None)*

### Configuration

The application is designed to be controlled exclusively with environment variables and secrets.

All secrets are expected to be files within a single folder. This folder can be set via environment variable (`SECRETS_DIR`) itself and defaults to `./.secrets` (git-ignored folder).

 - [List of environment variables](#environment-variables)
 - [List of secrets](#secrets)

#### Shell Exports

The existing [.env](./.env) file contains sane defaults for most necessary environment variables and is designed to let you overwrite any of those environment variables via exports from your shell before running the application.

*Example:*
```sh
export APP_HOST="my-habitat.example.com"
export APP_MODULES="path,scent,chatter,sight,hoard,vigil,vista"
export APP_SESSION_ID="$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)"
export APP_NAME_LABEL="MyHabitat"
export TIMEZONE="Europe/London"
export SECRETS_DIR="/run/secrets"
docker compose up
```

#### Repository ._env File

You can also create the file `._env` in the root directory of the cloned repository and instruct docker compose to use this file instead via the `--env-file` argument, i.e `docker compose up --env-file "./._env"` ([Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/variable-interpolation/)).

> ℹ️ The file `._env` is included in [.gitignore](./.gitignore) and is guaranteed to not interfere with future updates via `git pull`.

> *⚠️
> If this method is used you need to define **all** necessary environment variables from the [.env](./.env) file, as docker compose will not use that file as a fallback, it is therefore recommended to copy the current `.env` file and replace all variable values.
> ⚠️*

*Example:* [See .env](./.env)

#### Local .env File

It is also possible to create a `.env` file in an unrelated directory ([Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/variable-interpolation/#local-env-file-versus-project-directory-env-file)).

> ℹ️ In this case you need to set the additional variable `COMPOSE_FILE` to the path of the repository's compose file and all variables inside the [.env](./.env) file will be loaded as fallback, if your own `.env` file does not define them.

> ℹ️ You do not need to instruct docker compose to use this file as long as you run `docker compose up` from the directory containing your `.env` file.

*Example:*
```sh
# /path/to/your/.env
COMPOSE_FILE="/path/to/repository/compose.yml"
APP_HOST="my-habitat.example.com"
APP_MODULES="path,scent,chatter,sight,hoard,vigil,vista"
APP_SESSION_ID="$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)"
APP_NAME_LABEL="MyHabitat"
TIMEZONE="Europe/Madrid"
SECRETS_DIR="/run/secrets"
```

### Environment Variables

At build-time Docker requires the following environment variables to be populated:

| Name | Description | Example | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `APP_HOST` | The main URL the device will be reachable at. | `my-habitat.example.com` | *Empty* |
| `APP_MODULES` | A comma separated list of module names that are started in the same docker namespace (same project name) as this module. | `path,scent,chatter,sight,hoard,vigil,vista` | *Empty* |
| `APP_SESSION_ID` | A session ID used for synchronization of configuration between modules, should change every time all modules are restarted in unison and remain unchanged if a single module is restarted without being updated. | `$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)` | *Empty* |
| `APP_NAME_HOST` | The prefix for all docker networks and containers, that this application will create. Also used as the internal hostname within all containers. | `my-habitat` | `habitat` |
| `APP_NAME_LABEL` | The human readable name of the device. | `My Habitat` | `Habitat` |
| `TIMEZONE` | Timezone identifier passed on to containers. | `Europe/Paris` | `Europe/Berlin` |
| `VOLUME_DIR` | The directory in which [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) are placed *(Currently only named volumes are used)*. | `/path/to/my/volumes` | `./volumes` |
| `ENV_DIR` | The directory in which .env files for containers can be placed to override the default runtime config. | `/path/to/my/env` | `./env.d` |
| `SECRETS_DIR` | The directory in which files containing secrets for containers are placed. | `/run/secret` | `./secrets` |

### Secrets

The following secrets must exist within the `SECRETS_DIR` directory at build-time, otherwise running the stack will fail.
They are expected to be files with the secret value being the content of the file.

| (File) Name | Description | Documentation / How to Obtain |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_TOKEN_JSON` | The full admin token JSON for InfluxDB's first-time setup. | [InfluxDB Docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb3/enterprise/admin/tokens/admin/preconfigured/) |
| `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_TOKEN` | The token from the `token` field of the `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_TOKEN_JSON` secret. | [InfluxDB Docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb3/enterprise/admin/tokens/admin/preconfigured/) |

### Run the Application

 - Run `docker compose up` from the root directory of the repository or from the directory containing your `.env` file
 - Run `docker compose logs` and wait for the application to finish first-time setup and settle
